### now
- api views with generated meta features (cached where?)
- launch with migrated data
- begin ingestion modules
- resolution filter

### thoughts
- folders for uploaded data and for live accessible media is different

### questions
- files vs post body
- email vs api
- incoming as geojson or not
- mapbox is still pulling from me

### remember
- will have to re-migrate with altitude
