### need
- format for tablet ingestion, see email to Ellery
- verify ambit 3 format

### now
- front end to graph changes over time
- verify_t should be smarter
- async for soundcloud and twilio
- set up crons on server
- resolution filter
- send this shit to Ari and co
- "estimate geography" is only for shit from the main posting
- tweets have to be geotagged to the expedition members, not the general data
- core flag in each feature generated by whether the member is core or not
(manual core, or in proximity to data boat)
- two subsets of photo objects -- two different feature types
habitat (gopro) + documentary (people's photos)


### thoughts
- need a backup strategy, ebs snapshots
- move everything to /mnt/data?
- api view caching, especially with processing
- currently no protection on duplicates -- unique second/type keys probably ok except for ambit

### remember
- will have to clear out and re-migrate old with altitude once Mongo updates to 3.1.0 (hopefully soon!)
--> this is not going to happen before launch. can regenerate altitude data from lonlats in the future?



##### resolution filtering

supports:
- all
- hourly
- daily

does this make sense for all data? it's really just for position and heartrate, and it should be averaged, which means that it involves processing, which is complicated


##### timetable

Jer leaves NYC on May 8th, day 1 is the May 11th

Shah arrives on June 19, hangs out in the camps until meeting up with expedition around the 4th

There is paperwork for equipment
