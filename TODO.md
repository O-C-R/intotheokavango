### new / okavango_16

- ambit assignments need to be in an interface.

Data munging:
- great Egret error? on Slack
- missing geometry: http://intotheokavango.org/api/features?FeatureType=sighting&member=Paul

Interface:
- rebuild uploader (with Eric) -- sightings with photo attachment
- temporal scaling (experimental)

Server:
- triggered rather than cron'ed ingest -- ie, use beanstalk like you should have


### issues
- things that arent members or teams and wont be geotagged:
    intotheokavango twitter


### needed improvements
