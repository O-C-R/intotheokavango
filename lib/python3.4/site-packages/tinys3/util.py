    A simple class to wrap a stream and provide length capability
    for streams like cStringIO

     We do it because requests will try to fallback to chuncked transfer if
     it can't extract the len attribute of the object it gets, and S3 doesn't
     support chuncked transfer.
     In some cases, like cStringIO, it may cause some issues, so we wrap the stream
     with a class of our own, that will proxy the stream and provide a proper
     len attribute
