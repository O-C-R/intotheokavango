### now
- currently no protection on duplicates
- begin ingestion modules
- resolution filter

### thoughts
- might want to run everything off of /mnt/data considering static files (or use a hardlink?)
- folders for uploaded data and for live accessible media is different
- meta view caching

### questions
- files vs post body
- email vs api
- incoming as geojson or not
- mapbox is still pulling from me

### remember
- will have to re-migrate with altitude
