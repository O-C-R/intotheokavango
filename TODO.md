### now
- geo queries
- launch with migrated data
- begin ingestion modules
- resolution filter
- max points

### thoughts
- return feature collections
- folders for uploaded data and for live accessible media is different
- meta-views, like members of an expedition (+date range), species sighted, etc

### questions for Jer
- files vs post body
- email vs api
- incoming as geojson or not
- mapbox is still pulling from me

### remember
- will have to re-migrate with altitude
