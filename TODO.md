### unresolved
- procedure for uploading images and audio
    member, 
- gopro differentiation
- sightings have photos, that are photo features, linked to sightings
- add SensorType to shah
- tweet members should not be null -- except what about organizations?

### server
- migrate to huge instance
- backups to s3
- http auth
- multiple tornado frontends
- set up crons on server

### security


### now
- verify_t should be smarter
- async for soundcloud and twilio
- resolution filter

- http://www.gbif.org/developer/species


- "estimate geography" is only for shit from the main posting -- what is NOT geotagged that needs this?
- tweets have to be geotagged to the expedition members, not the general data
- core flag in each feature generated by whether the member is core or not
(manual core, or in proximity to data boat)

- is there a calculated exhibition core?


### thoughts
- send this shit to Ari and co
- need a backup strategy, ebs snapshots
- move everything to /mnt/data?
- api view caching, especially with processing
- currently no protection on duplicates -- unique second/type keys probably ok except for ambit

### remember
- will have to clear out and re-migrate old with altitude once Mongo updates to 3.1.0 (hopefully soon!)
--> this is not going to happen before launch. can regenerate altitude data from lonlats in the future?



##### resolution filtering

supports:
- all
- hourly
- daily

does this make sense for all data? it's really just for position and heartrate, and it should be averaged, which means that it involves processing, which is complicated


##### timetable

Jer leaves NYC on May 8th, day 1 is the May 11th

Shah arrives on June 19, hangs out in the camps until meeting up with expedition around the 4th

There is paperwork for equipment


##### backup

pip install awscli
