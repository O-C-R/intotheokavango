- verify snapshots are happening on schedule

### new
- add SensorType (FeatureSubType) to SMS sensors
- WordPress RSS -- handles just like tweets
- resolution should be in the response metadata
- add totals to species counts
- okavango 13

### bugs
- access control issues on errors

### server
- http auth
- set up crons on server

### security
- this needs to happen now

### improvments
- verify_t should be smarter
- async for soundcloud and twilio
- resolution filter


### geo
- "estimate geography" is only for shit from the main posting -- what is NOT geotagged that needs this?
- tweets have to be geotagged to the expedition members, not the general data
- same with ambit data
- core flag in each feature generated by whether the member is core or not
(manual core, or in proximity to data boat)

- it could be that geo_estimator flags everything within sight of the beacon as core, and then intermediate points are assigned to the closest cores

- what needs to be geo-estimated?
tweets, images, audio

- is there a calculated exhibition core?

core is Steve's ambit


### thoughts
- send this shit to Ari and co
- need a backup strategy, ebs snapshots
- move everything to /mnt/data?
- api view caching, especially with processing
- currently no protection on duplicates -- unique second/type keys probably ok except for ambit

### remember
- will have to clear out and re-migrate old with altitude once Mongo updates to 3.1.0 (hopefully soon!)



### conceptual
- ingest defines anything that needs to be parsed differently, a loose correlation to FeatureTypes
- ingest might end up producing multiple features, via ingest_request, ingest_data
- whether ingest always happens through http or not is somewhat compromised
